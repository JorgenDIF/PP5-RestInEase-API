## <a id="introduction">Introduction</a>

The Rest In Ease API is designed to manage user-generated content such as posts and comments, allowing users to express their emotions and categorize their content. Currently, certain fields like mood, category, and feeling are hardcoded in both the frontend and backend due to time constraints. In the frontend, these fields are placed in separate files as a compromise to maintain modularity. However, in future iterations, these fields will be fully integrated into the backend models, enabling more flexibility and easier updates. This temporary solution was implemented to meet the project deadline, and enhancing this functionality is a planned improvement.

### <a id="crud-functionality">Crud functionality</a>

The API has CRUD functionality for the following models:

## <a id="agile-methodology">Agile Methodology</a>

The project was developed using Agile methodology

## <a id="frontend">Frontend</a>

The frontend is a React app that is connected to the API

## <a id="database">Database</a>

### <a id="erd">Erd</a>

The ERD for the project:

</details>

### <a id="models">Models</a>

The models for the project are as follows:

- User
- Profile
- Followers
- Likes
- Comments
- Posts

I followed the walthrough from Code Institute to create the models but I customized 2 of them to suit my project. The models are as follows:


- Posts: I added a field called mood to the posts model to allow users to add their mood to their posts. I also added a field called category to the posts model to allow users to categorize their posts. During the development process, I initially hardcoded mood and category fields directly into the Post model, but I later realized that a more dynamic approach would have been better. This realization came as I noticed how reusable and flexible separate models for these fields could be across the application. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, I didnâ€™t implement this solution at the time. However, I plan to refactor the current setup to create dedicated models for mood and category in the future, which is part of my future features roadmap.
- 	Comments: For the comments, I followed a similar approach by adding a feeling field directly into the Comment model to allow users to express their emotions. During the development process, I realized that creating a separate Feeling model would have been a more dynamic and reusable solution across different parts of the application. However, due to time constraints, I integrated it directly. I plan to refactor this in the future for improved scalability by implementing a dedicated Feeling model. This refactor is part of my future development roadmap.
